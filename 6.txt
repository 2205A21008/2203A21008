In C programming, the two main types of files are text files and binary files. The key difference between them lies in how the data is stored and interpreted.

Text Files :
***********
1)Text files store data as a sequence of characters. Each character is represented using an encoding scheme, such as ASCII or UTF-8.
2)The contents of text files are human-readable and can be opened and edited using text editors.
3)Text files typically contain plain text, such as letters, numbers, symbols, and newline characters.
4)They are read and written using text-oriented I/O functions like fopen, fprintf, fscanf, fgets, and fputs.
5)Examples: source code files (.c, .h), configuration files, log files, and text-based data files (CSV, XML, JSON).

Binary Files :
*************
1)Binary files store data in its raw binary format. The data is not interpreted as characters but as a series of bytes.
2)The contents of binary files are not intended to be human-readable and may contain any type of data, including binary data, structures, or serialized objects.
3)They can store complex data structures without any concern for character encoding or formatting.
4)They files are read and written using binary-oriented I/O functions like fopen, fwrite, fread, fseek, and ftell.
5)Examples: image files (BMP, JPEG), audio files (WAV, MP3), video files (MP4, AVI), and compiled object files (.o, .dll).
